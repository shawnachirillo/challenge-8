# Challenge 8: TypeScript Vehicle CLI 

This is a Node.js CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in TypeScript that allows users to create and interact with various vehicle types â€” including Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes. Users can simulate actions like accelerating, stopping, printing details, towing, and even doing a wheelie (yes, really ðŸ˜Ž).
